Shifter pico is quick drop in solution to interface Logitech shifter trough Raspberry pi pico w as a standalone USB controller
It maps all gear states to button 1-6 + Reverse gear to button 7.

To make it work wire serial connector to pico as follows:
Serial 2 to pin 34 GP28
Serial 3 to Serial 9 (Otherwise reverse sense won't work)
Serial 4 to pin 32 ADC1
Serial 6 to any GND pin on pico
Serial 7 to pin 36 3v3(OUT)
Serial 8 to pin 31 ADC0

Once that's done download circuit python for the board from https://circuitpython.org/downloads

Follow instructions from the website.

Once that's done drag and drop source files and lib folder to your pico w.

If you don't want to have to deal with pico showing as usb drive remove boot.py and rename the boot_disable_storage.py to boot.py and restart the board.

If you need to reset your pico to fresh state you can follow this guide https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/circuitpython
